# DashboardDjango
Develop an interactive dashboard in Django that features a pie chart, doughnut chart, and bar graph. The dashboard will read data from a CSV file and generate a line graph based on this data. Users will have the ability to modify the data, and the graphs will update accordingly to reflect these changes.
